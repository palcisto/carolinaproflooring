                  <h3>What is buff and coat?</h3>
                  <p>It is a light dustless sanding process that sands off the top layer of the wood which in most cases eliminates the old scratched,dull and dirty finish. Bringing life back to the good looking shape it once had with a fresh top coat adding a long lasting life expectancy without the need of a full refinish process. It's the most affordable,quick and hassle free process that can be done to most floors,mostly done by real state agents,costumers with heavy foot traffic also those looking to keep their wood floors looking like new for a long life expectancy floors.</p>
                  <p>Wood floors are constantly getting abused by normal tear and wear and most homeowners don't realize the importance of regular  maintenance to their wood floors until is too late!</p>
                  <h3>Not all wood floors can be recoated!</h3>
                  <p>Floors that can't be recoated may have been finished and/or maintened with various type waxes and/or maintened with silicon cleaners or oil soaps. Those are nearly impossible to recoat as a fresh coat of polyurethane simply won't bond to them. Even after a aggressive buffing process and deeper cleaning using either paint thinner or water to tack clean it might not be enough to provide a safe bond leading to a unsatisfying finishing process. Also most floors pre-finished floors that were manufactured with aluminum oxide coats,these finishes are so hard that mechanical screening doesn't create enough of a bonding texture. Some Aluminum oxide finishes can be recoated but they have to special treated with chemicals that will allow a decent bond before finishing process.</p>

                  <p>Carolina Pro Flooring has its roots in a two-decade, family-shared passion for excellence and beauty in wood flooring.
                    <br> Rafael Ferreira, at the heart of Carolina Pro Flooring, discovered his own vision for providing quality custom wood flooring designs while apprenticing under his father and uncles.</p>
                  <p>The collective wisdom and experience of his family, along with valuable opportunities to work with other established flooring companies, has given Rafael insight and knowledge into the best practices for the craft including material selection, treatment, design, and installation. These experiences, combined with a desire to provide highest quality wood flooring service, led to the creation of Carolina Pro Flooring, or CPF.</p>

                  <p>The flooring industry is full of innovative designers offering high-quality, elegant solutions to the market’s wood flooring needs. Unfortunately, the highest level of artistic attention to beautiful floors comes at a high price.

                    <br>We wish to offer client-centered services that provide you with ease, peace of mind, and confidence in knowing that your floors are in the hands of professionals that do not compromise quality. We believe that when your priorities become our own, the result will be floors that you will love.</p>
